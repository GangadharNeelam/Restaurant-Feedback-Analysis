### Step 01
* Initially collected data from the resource provided by the company in the form of tsv. After that imported the data in the form of data frame by using pandas module.
### Step 02
* Performed data wrangling and did visualization which represents the number of positive reviews and negative reviews in the data by using matplotlib and seaborn.
### Step 03
* Pre processed the data and created a model by using Support Vector Machine. It gives the accuracy of 47% which is very low.
### Step 04
* Created a Multinomial Naive Bayes model which gives the accuracy of 76% which is quite good.
### Step 04
* After that created pipe lines for both SVC and Naive Bayes models.
### Step 05
* Saved the best model by that is naive bayes by using joblib which is similar to pickle.
### Step 06
Finally created a streamlit web app for sentiment analysis using the joblib model.
